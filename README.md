# Rotate Problem

A common programming problem is to rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise. Refer to the example below, 

Input Matrix    After Rotation
[ 1 2 3 ]             [ 7 4 1 ]
[ 4 5 6 ]             [ 8 5 2 ]
[ 7 8 9 ]             [ 9 6 3 ]

I want to apply the logic above in a real-world scenario where we need to rotate 90 degrees a 24bit BITMAP image. The input file is always a square BMP. A square BMP would mean that the size of the height (px) and width (px) is equal ( 4 x 4 , 2 x 2, 8 x 8, 16 x 16 ). Use the programming language of your choice.
